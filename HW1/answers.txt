a. Doing so by hand would probably take a few days. (assuming we cannot use any kind of computational assistance to solve the problem)

b. From this assignment, we learned that linux and Bash can be very versatile, and used in an easier manner than other coding languages.
We think that this kind of assignment can be modified in order to solve data analysis problem, for web crawling tools and for information gathering.

c. In order to repeat this action every hour, we would use the results.csv file as a list of already scanned urls and add to each url a field of
"last time modified". Then, every hour, we would scan the root page for new urls and newly modified urls we scanned earlier. That way we would minimize
the amount of times we download and scan each page and therefore decreasing the average running time of the code. In order to automize the action, 
we would use the cron function to activate the program each hour.
